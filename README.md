- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anika-Lakhani, a senior at Harvard with a pending bachelor's and Master's in CS.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in entrepreneurship, cognitive science, activism, and technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about blockchain, AI, and computer science in general.
- ðŸ’¬ I would describe myself more as a technologist than a technical person... I like working with cool technology but preferably am not the one directly building it :)
- ðŸ”Ž In accordance with being a technologist, you'll find that my GitHub is really an exploration of what I'm curious about instead of a concerted effort to build really difficult things.
- Check me out on LinkedIn to learn more about my work experience! www.linkedin.com/in/anika-lakhani
