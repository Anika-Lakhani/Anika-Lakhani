- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anika-Lakhani, a recent grad from Harvard with an honors bachelor's and Master's in CS.
- 👀 I’m interested in entrepreneurship, cognitive science, activism, and technology. I'm very passionate about working on tech that actually improves the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about blockchain, AI, and computer science in general. I'm also a Technical PM at Microsoft under Azure Cloud, Data, and AI.
- 💬 I would describe myself more as a technologist than a technical person... I like working with cool technology but preferably am not the one directly building it :)
- 🔎 In accordance with being a technologist, you'll find that my GitHub is really an exploration of what I'm curious about instead of a concerted effort to build really difficult things.
- Check me out on LinkedIn to learn more about my work experience! www.linkedin.com/in/anika-lakhani
